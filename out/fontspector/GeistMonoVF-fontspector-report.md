- ⚠️ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are
     inferred from the typical amounts of contours observed in a
     large collection of reference font families. The divergences
     listed below may simply indicate a significantly different
     design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these
     may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an
     incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and
     codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.


    The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:
* uni01CE.ss02 (unencoded): found 2, expected one of: {3, 4}
* uni24FF (U+24FF): found 4, expected one of: {3}
* fraction (U+2044): found 2, expected one of: {1}

- ⚠️ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are
     inferred from the typical amounts of contours observed in a
     large collection of reference font families. The divergences
     listed below may simply indicate a significantly different
     design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these
     may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an
     incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and
     codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.


    The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:
* uni24FF (U+24FF): found 4, expected one of: {3}
* fraction (U+2044): found 2, expected one of: {1}
* uni23CE (U+23CE): found 8, expected one of: {1, 4, 2}
* radical (U+221A): found 3, expected one of: {1, 2}
