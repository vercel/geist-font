After this is a demonstration of Geist Sans in regular and bold face that shows alphanumeric characters and some symbols, notably a symbol for Shift, a right arrow, and the Vercel logo. Below is some text written in Geist - a heading: “Geist truly represents the coding and design spirit within Vercel's creator community.”, one paragraph: “At Vercel, we've developed Geist, a typeface specifically designed for developers and designers. We began by creating a monospace version that prioritized readability and seamlessly integrated into coding environments. After perfecting the monospace variant, we expanded Geist into a Sans version, adding versatility to its capabilities.”, and another next to it: “Geist embodies our design principles of simplicity, minimalism, and speed, drawing inspiration from the renowned Swiss design movement.

# Geist Sans & Geist Mono
Geist is a new font family for Vercel, created by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/design) in collaboration with [Basement Studio](https://basement.studio/).

Geist Sans is a sans-serif typeface designed for legibility and simplicity. It is a modern, geometric typeface that is based on the principles of [classic Swiss typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Typographic_Style). It is designed to be used in headlines, logos, posters, and other large display sizes.

Geist Mono is a monospaced typeface that has been crafted to be the perfect partner to Geist Sans. It is designed to be used in code editors, diagrams, terminals, and other textbased interfaces where code is represented.
