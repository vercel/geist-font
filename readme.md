# Geist Sans & Geist Mono
Geist is a new font family for Vercel, created by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/design) in collaboration with [Basement Studio](https://basement.studio/).

Geist Sans is a sans-serif typeface designed for legibility and simplicity. It is a modern, geometric typeface that is based on the principles of [classic Swiss typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Typographic_Style). It is designed to be used in headlines, logos, posters, and other large display sizes.

Geist Mono is a monospaced typeface that has been crafted to be the perfect partner to Geist Sans. It is designed to be used in code editors, diagrams, terminals, and other textbased interfaces where code is represented.
